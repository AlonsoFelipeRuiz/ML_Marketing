# ML_Marketing

In this project, three scenarios related to marketing and customer relationship management (Customer Relationship Management) are presented. The first scenario involves developing a complete pipeline for predicting customer churn (Churn prevention). In the second scenario, a model is developed to estimate the potential value of a customer (Customer Lifetime Value). Finally, unsupervised learning is used to segment a set of customers into groups.

This project will also include some interpretations and analysis of the process. This approach will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the marketing and customer management tasks being undertaken in the project.
